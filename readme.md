# Rebuilding MooTools

MooTools was once the jewel of artisanal JavaScript development.  By deconstructing it, we can learn what made it great.

This book is part of a set of resources, aimed at learning MooTools from the inside out. Other resources are:

- [http://rebuildingmootools.com](http://rebuildingmootools.com)
- [https://medium.com/rebuilding-mootools](https://medium.com/rebuilding-mootools)

The content (there) will remain free. This book is also free, and I intend to keep it that way. If you have found it helpful, and would like to help me continue to devote a considerable amount of time towards additional content, you can donate by purchasing a copy of this book. Please don't feel under any obligation to do so!
